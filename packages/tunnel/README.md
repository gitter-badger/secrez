# @secrez/tunnel

**_A fork of https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel with restricted functions in order to be used by Secrez_**

This is a restricted, modified version of the original localtunnel, with the goal of allowing only encrypted communication between Secrez users.

It is used internally by the @secrez/courier and it is not supposed to be used directly.
